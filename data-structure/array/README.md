# Array

Array are one of the most known data structures. Arrays are list-like objects whose prototype has methods to perform traversal and mutation operations. Neither the length of a JavaScript array nor the types of its elements are fixed.

## Basic Operation

Array have many operation, that you can see on `index.js`. Operations like splice, unshift, pop, and push. (Static Array).

## Static and Dynamic Array

A dynamic array is a random access, variable-size list data structure that allows elements to be added or removed.

## Implementing an Array

We can implement an array in many way. Here are example of array implementation: `implement.js`.

## Reverse a string in array

In Javascript, there's a many way to reverse a string using array method. Open `reverse-string.js` to look at 3 example of how to do that.

## Merge and Sort Array

Given 2 array with bunch of number. Example [2,4,10,123] & [2,5,14,20]. Then we need to find each first array item from 2 array. And finally looping the array with while loop and using if statement inside, to determine which item from both side is bigger.

The example you can learn from `merge-sorted-array.js` file.
